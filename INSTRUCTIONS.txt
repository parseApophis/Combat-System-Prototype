You need to have Python downloaded onto your PC in order to run this game.

If you came here from Maeve's Academy, you most likely have it already.

The version used is Python 3.11.

You can download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you download Python, you can either run the "CombatSystemPrototype" Python file directly, or use an IDE to access the code and see what it has.

You have to type in the NUMBER or EXACT NAME of the action. All-caps applies. If you don't, the game dies. I kept it like this because I wasn't going to remake my "check if they gave a proper input" checker again. Just type it exactly, plz.

Most of the code is documented. Feel free to use anything here.

If anything breaks, kindly tell @apophis_florp on Discord.

Out of all my passion projects for MA, I think this is the one I found the most fun. This is, like, my third combat system. Sadly, they're all command line projects, so, lol.

Thanks again!
